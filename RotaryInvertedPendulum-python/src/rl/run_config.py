"""Per-run training-config provenance.

`train_sac.py` and `finetune_async.py` write a `config.json` into the run
directory recording the knobs that MUST match between training, fine-tuning,
and deployment (action mode, control rate, action scaling, reward extras).
Both action modes share identical obs/action spaces, so a checkpoint loaded
with the wrong flags fails silently — behaving nonsensically on the rig
instead of erroring. The deploy/fine-tune entrypoints call `check_config()`
to compare their CLI args against the checkpoint's recorded config and abort
on mismatch (`--ignore-config-mismatch` downgrades the abort to a warning).

Checkpoints predating this file have no config.json; validation is skipped.
