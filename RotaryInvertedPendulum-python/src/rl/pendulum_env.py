"""Gymnasium environment for the rotary inverted pendulum, parameterised
from the system-identification fits in sysid_params.json.

Geometry (Furuta pendulum):
    - Arm rotates about a vertical axis, driven by a position-controlled
      "motor" (modelling the AccelStepper + driver as a stiff PD).
    - Pendulum hinges at the end of the arm, free-swinging in the vertical
      plane perpendicular to the arm direction. Hangs straight down at rest.

Observation (5-dim):
    [motor_pos, sin(theta), cos(theta), motor_vel, pendulum_vel]
    where theta = 0 is upright (so cos(theta) = 1 at the goal).

Action (1-dim, in [-1, 1]) — interpreted per `action_mode`:
    - "accel" (default): commanded angular acceleration in
      [-max_accel, +max_accel] rad/s²; integrated to a capped velocity and
      then a position target fed to the PD actuator.
    - "velocity": commanded angular velocity in [-max_vel, +max_vel] rad/s.
      Converted to an acceleration each tick via a saturating P-law
      (accel = clip((v_des − v)/dt, ±max_accel)) and then integrated exactly
      like accel mode — same firmware transport (CMD_SET_ACCEL), one fewer
      integrator between action and pendulum coupling. The velocity cap
      becomes the explicit action bound instead of a hidden saturation.
    - "position_delta": per-step motor-position delta
      (action × max_action_delta_rad), integrated into the commanded target,
      clamped, and fed to the PD actuator through a first-order
      motor-bandwidth lag. The mode RLControl.ino runs on-device.

Reward:
    upright term      = (1 + cos(theta)) / 2     in [0, 1]
    motor-pos penalty = -k_pos * (motor_pos / motor_limit)^2
    motor-vel penalty = -k_vel * motor_vel^2
    action penalty    = -k_act * action^2
